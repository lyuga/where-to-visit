# Where to visit
A travel website built using OpenWeatherMap and Foursquare API to retrieve weather and venue information.

## Introduction
In this project, I have built a website for travelers.

Users can look up for places to visit based on their destination.

The website displays weather section which users can choose either Celsius or Fahrenheit for temperature units.

By default, venues are selected as "Top Picks".
However, there are other options available such as food, drinks, coffee, shops, arts, outdoors and sights.
Choosing one of these category limits venues to be recommended based on your interest.
